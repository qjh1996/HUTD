# Nearshore Underwater Target Detection Meets UAV-borne Hyperspectral Remote Sensing: A Benchmark Dataset&#x20;

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains a novel HUTD benchmark dataset, **ATR2-UTR**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

We introduce ATR2-HUTD, a new dataset designed for HUTD. The ATR2-HUTD dataset, comprising three sub-datasets collected from diverse aquatic environments (lake, river, and sea), addresses scene diversity limitations and data size constraints by offering larger image dimensions (up to 3536Ã—6403536Ã—640 pixels) and enhanced spatial details, thereby improving model generalization and robustness for real-world hyperspectral underwater target detection tasks.

### ðŸ”½ Download
